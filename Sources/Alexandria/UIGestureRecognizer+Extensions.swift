     Convenience initializer, associating an action closure with the gesture recognizer (instead of the more traditional target/action).

There is no pre-logic to conditionally invoke the closure or not (e.g. only invoke the closure if the gesture recognizer is in a particular state). The closure is merely invoked directly; all handler logic is up to the closure.
     
     - returns: The UIGestureRecognizer.
